# File Extension and Compression
All mods should use the `*.mod_pak` extension.

All mods should be stored in a `tar` ball, with either `xz` or `zip` compression. `xz` compression is preferred for mods 20 MB and over, and `zip` is preferred for anything under that size, but which compression format used is left up to repository maintainers.
